This is the shader renderer backend of MMV project, called Sombrero.

It is heavily borked right now since I cut the project in half and working on a GUI based thing.

The joke here is the almighty mexican hat and.. well.. shaders, "sombreadores" in Portuguese, "the shadower", so, welp, why I'm explaining the joke?
