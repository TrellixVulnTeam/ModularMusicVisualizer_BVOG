## Reporting a Vulnerability
 
There should be no real vulnerabilities on the code as I don't work with security stuff here (like a password manager or something else), but a merely video generator out of a scripting sequence.

## Reporting private info, leak on the code
 
Please if I ever managed to leak some private info of mine, a directory or two, ctrl v or middle mouse button Linux paste content, enter in contact with me on Telegram `@tremeschin`
