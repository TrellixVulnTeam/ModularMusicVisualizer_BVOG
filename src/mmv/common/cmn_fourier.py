        # n = log(sample_rate / original_sample_rate) / log(2)
        # where sample_rate / original_sample_rate = ratio
        #
        # We use log10 cause it's faster than ln, on my pc:
        # 
        #   >>> s = time.time(); b = [math.log(x) for x in range(1, 10000000)]; time.time() - s
        #   2.073245048522949

        #   1.3057165145874023
        #
        # The expression would be the following:
        #
        fft = self.fft(data) * (math.log10(original_sample_rate / sample_rate) / math.log10(2))
        # 
        # We could use the following log law to simplify it:
        #
        # $$ \log_b (a) = \frac{\log_{10} (a)}{\log_{10} (b)} $$
        #
        # So we end up calculating the log_2 (ratio)
        #
        # fft = self.fft(data) * (math.log(original_sample_rate / sample_rate, 2))
        #
        # .. But Python math's module is more optimized for finding the log10 and
        # calculating 2 logs then dividing ends up faster than a custom base log.
        # The log2 above is about the intuition of it I guess..

        # Only need the first half of frequencies cause imaginary mirroring
        fftf = fftf[1 : len(fftf) // 2]

        # # Return pairs of [freq, fft]

        # We return a single array with pairs of ffreq and fft
        # So we do a vertical stack, that is:
        #
        # a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        # b = [6, 7, 8, 9, 0]

        #       [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
        #        [6, 7, 8, 9, 0]]
        # 
        # Then  we transpose it, that is, flip it 90Â° clockwise then
        # mirror vertically so we end up with the pairs:
        #
        # c.T ->
        #   [[1, 6],
        #    [2, 7],
        #    [3, 8],
        #    [4, 9],
        #    [5, 0]]
        #
        # Which is what our specification says and what we need.
        #
        # Note that the first array is the index 0 of each vector
        # so we represent it with th eFFT frequencies and that's why
        # we put fftf first than fft, actually it is already explicitly
        # in the order we want.
